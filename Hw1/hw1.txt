Part 2 - Summary

Write a two-page summary (roughly 120 to 140 lines)  which discusses
the three (or more) video segments you watched.  Be sure to consider
(at least) the following issues:

	* What is the quality of the image - is it jagged, smooth, etc.?

	* Is the image solid or wire-frame?

	* Is the 3-D image a real 3-D or a faked one using 2-D?
	  Support your answer (i.e., what clues did you use?).

	* How is color used?

	* Is there animation?

	* How complex are the images?
	
	* How has computer graphics changed over the years represented
	  here?

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Segment 1

	The first video watched is called Pioneer 11 Encounters Saturn. It is 
a Computer Simulation of how saturn would look to us. The video is 
interesting in many ways. Firstly it was an early attempt to use computer 
graphics to help us visualize planets in our solar system. The video lacks
a lot of detail which is why it may look smooth. Since it uses a lot of 
tricks like image mapping instead of polygon shaping to achieve detail it 
looks smooth to our perspective. Some examples to describe our earlier 
discussion where - The asteroid belt is an image map rather than a polygon 
construction of the model. This is noticed when the camera zooms closer to 
the object. A bright star in the background is an image map of its bright 
state as its state does change as the perspective changes. The objects shown 
in the video are all solid since we cannot see through them. 
	The animation consists of part 3D and 2D objects(with tricks). For example,
the probe and the planet are constructed in 3D since they are clearly shown 
rotating, but at the same time the heavenly objects in the background of the 
scene may look like distant stars but they were created using a global background
image map. This can be noticed since they always move equidistant to one another
even while the perspective constantly changes. The color depth of the video 
was really low. Even though video was set in space there seemed to be no black
color levels. The video had an excessive amount of blue shading which was 
strange. 
	Strange things to note was that lighting techniques were probably not 
implemented earlier that time. Since most of the objects were a lot brighter 
than they should have been. For example, both sides of the probe was bright. 
As it was rotating illumination on the probe was not affected at all, indicating 
no dynamic lighting techniques. Also although half of saturn was dark, more 
than 80% of the ring was bright. This was probably due to the fact that the 
image mapped onto the planet for its texture was created with bright and dark 
shades as a trick to compensate lack of lighting techniques which was once 
again very interesting for it's time.
	There is a good amount of animation. The basics of rotating, translation 
and scaling can be seen here. The animation technique most likely used was 
keyframing. The reasoning behind that is because it was more famous during 
that time period rather than behavioural rules. Also on closer inspection, 
the way the probes moves (i.e translating from one position and then abruptly 
stopping without physics) indicates manual movement defined by the programmer 
via keyframing. The images used for mapping are fairly simple. The idea for 
its time to use a global image in the background instead of a plain color 
like older videos was definitely a very interesting idea. Hence, paving the 
way to the future of graphics industry tricks and techniques.

Segment 2

	The second video chosen is Bingo. Also referred to as "Bingo! Bingo the 
Clown-O!". The reason I choose this video is since it has fascinated me for 
a long time. I will get to interesting features once I cover the basics. 
The video uses more recent animations techniques and has hence improved over
its predecessors in many facets. The animation quality is a lot smoother
with a higher resolution than the previously compared video. The animation
probably comprises of a few thousand polygon which improves the level of detail
in the animation. The image is once again solid since we can't see though them.
	Once again tricks have been used to used to reduce number of polygons used.
For example, even thought the jump suit of the clown looks 3D its actually a 
single 2D texture map. This can be noticed since the strap of the jump suit is 
in the same 3D domain as the shirt. It also moves as once single entity with 
respect to the clown devoid of any fabric physics. Either way, most of the 
objects are 3D world objects which pushed the animation domain a lot further
with the number of polygons created.
	Construction of the human being has always been a challenge and will still 
be for a few more years. The animation detail in this video gives rise to the 
phycology issues concerned with creating an "almost-human" appearance. This 
intern gave rise to the issue known as "uncanny valley" in computer graphics
nowadays. People would always notice the imperfections of the human animation 
which is why whenever they noticed Bingo the clown they would feel uncomfortable
due to the "uncanny valley effect". Recent computer games and movie effects are 
trying techniques to reduce the effect of uncanny valley so that people aren't 
put off by the animation.
	Colors are really vivid and the animation techniques are well done, bringing
life to the imagination. Some technical improvements seen in animation industry
can be noticed by the particle physics used. Smoke physics, dynamics shadows, 
rope physics, diffusion of light(radiosity) on objects such as shirt and floor, 
basic ray tracing to trace certain objects on the actors glasses etc are some 
of the interesting animation techniques implemented.

Segment 3

	The third video chosen is the World of Warcraft's Cataclysm Intro.
The animation segment pushes computer graphics to a whole new domain. Created
by Blizzard Entertainment, they have always been known to push video game 
graphics (well at-least their cutscenes) to the limits. The animation is 
extremely detailed. The video is available in full 1080 resolution and the 
colours are all in high detail. Each actor such as a dragon or ogre probably 
has about a million polygons in its construction.
	Almost every object noticeable is fully constructed in 3D. The animation
is top-notch with everything moving as lifelike as possible. The dragon flies
with the force of its heavy weight which is noticeable in the video. Metallic
object hit and sound as hard as possible. Water moves fluidly thanks to water/
fluid dynamic engines. Water, chain, smoke, fire, trees, wind, terrain all 
have believable real world physics which make them look as amazing as possible.
Material physics in air balloons, dragon wings, object shelters etc are also 
implemented well.
	Real time dynamic lighting created by objects, subsurface scattering of 
textures(Where-in light diffuses individually on skin based on the amount of 
light each area of the skin absorbs) are also noticeable on the ogre and dragon.
The number of particles simulation has definitely come a very very long way since
its predecessors and is definitely observable in this video. Rendering a scene like
this a few years back would have probably taken... a few years.
	The dynamics between the dragon interacting with the scene to create waves
in the water and create a force to move buildings have been impressively 
applied. Azeroth - the name of the dragon, looks amazingly believable and pushes
computer graphics to a whole new level. It'll be interesting to see what else 
the future holds for us and whats the next stage for computer graphics.
