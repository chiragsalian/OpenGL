Before answering each of the following questions, type the 'r' command in
the tutorial program window to reset the function parameters to their
original state.

=========================================================================

Part 1 - Orthographic Projection using glOrtho()

Describe the changes you made to the gluLookAt() parameters to produce
your Orthographic image:

ANSWER
The Orthographic image defined these basic parameters for the camera - left,
right, bottom, top, near, far. These parameters defined the basic viewport for the camera.
The gluLookAt values defined are as follows,
gluLookAt(-0.30, 0.10, 2.40, -0.10, 0.00, 0.00, 0.30, 2.00, 1.50);

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Part 2 - Frustum Projection using glFrustum()

Describe the changes you made to the gluLookAt() parameters to produce
your Frustum image:

ANSWER
The Frustum image defined these basic parameters for the camera - left,
right, bottom, top, near, far. These parameters defined the basic viewport for the camera.
The gluLookAt values defined are as follows,
gluLookAt(-0.30, 0.10, 2.40, -0.10, 0.00, 0.00, 0.30, 2.00, 1.50);

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Part 3 - Perspective Projection using gluPerspective()

Describe the changes you made to the gluLookAt() parameters to produce
your Perspective image:

ANSWER
The Perspective image defined these basic parameters for the camera - fovy, aspect, zNear
zFar. These parameters defined the basic viewport for the camera.
The gluLookAt values defined are as follows,
gluLookAt(-0.30, 0.10, 2.40, -0.10, 0.00, 0.00, 0.30, 2.00, 1.50

Part 4 - Comparison of the three projection types

Describe, in your own words, the differences between the three types of
projections in terms of the overall effects (appearance, size, distortion,
etc.) on the model.

ANSWER
The reason i have maintained the same gluLookAt for the three projection types was to
observe differences while still keeping the view the same.
After playing around with multiple values it feels like an evolution of projection systems
wherein first orthographic projection was first made to observe our objects. But it didn't
simulate a human eye since the aspect ratio of the start of the view is the same as the 
aspect ratio of the end of the view. This in-turn removes any sense of depth in the 
viewport. This way it would be hard to identify what objects are behind which one unless 
they overlap one another.
The frustum evolved to compensate on that. It simulates the human eye which includes a
depth perception due to scaling aspect ratio on our viewport. Due to which the image looks
smaller as we go far away. Whereas in the orthographic view that would not happen as we 
go away form the object. This can be seen in our image as well. Even though the camera is 
slightly lowered the head still looks as big as the body which shouldn't happen and its 
supposed to appear smaller since its faster away.
The perspective evolved further by defining easier initialisation variables. By having
just 4 variables fovy, aspect, zNear and zFar it was possible to define all the important
initialisation for the projection. Aspect scales evenly which is same as defining left and
right in the earlier projection systems. The same can be said for the other variables as 
well. As for appearance, perspective and Frutum are similar to one another.
