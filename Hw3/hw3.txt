Part 1 - Effect of modifications to texture mapping parameters

Describe, in your own words, why the changes you made to the texture
mapping parameters and texture coordinates produced the result image you
submitted.

So the changes I made are as follows,
- glTextParamteri GL_Texture_Wrap_T as GL_Clamp
- GL_TEXTURE_ENV_MODE to G_REPLACE to make the image clearer

The coordinate position in the same order as they appeared to the following values,
- glTexCoord2f(0.4,0.3)
- glTexCoord2f(0.8,0.1)
- glTexCoord2f(1.3,0.7)
- glTexCoord2f(0.4,0.9)

By setting GL_Texture_Wrap_T as GL_Clamp we can modify the top and bottom part of the 
image to not repeat itself into tiles and instead stretch its version out.

The coordinates position start from bottom-left then goes to bottom-right then to 
top-right and finally to top-right. Since I wanted to move left side of the image more 
right to crop the first man i had to edit the 1st and 4rth coodinate from (0.0,0.0) &
(0.0,1.0) to (0.4,0.3) & (0.4,0.9). This also moved the coordinates slightly slower to 
match the lining with the top part of the fishing pole.
Then for the top-right I had to move the coordinate to (1.3,1.4) which moves to the area
of the repeated tile to repeat the sunset in the texture. Finally I needed to move the 
bottom right coordinate slightly higher and left otherwise the repeated tiles image 
from the top-right wouldâ€™ve spanned the entire height of the texture. Moving it to 
(0.8,0.1) matched the desired texture more closely.
